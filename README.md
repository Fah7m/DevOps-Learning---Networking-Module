# DevOps-Learning---Networking-Module

The networking module is a core module that I enjoyed as I thought it was going to be much harder and complex than I imagined. 

In this readme I will document some key points learnt in this module for quick access or a quick read










Troubleshooting

***Troubleshooting commands that can be used***

1. dig/nslookup google.com  - to verify any issues with DNS
2. ping IP/google.com - to check if the network is fine
3. traceroute google.com - to check the path the data packet is taking - if I search google.com i want to know the path my network or data packet is taking e.g. going through my computer, to the router to a different network
   until it reaches the final endpoint
