Computer Networks
---
A LAN would be Home wifi as its small and covers a limited area. 

A WAN would be like the internet as it connects home, schools and businesses worldwide

The WAN concept basically connects a multiple of LANs to enable communication and data transfer over long distances

**Switches** operate as a manager for your local network. It connects multiple devices within the same network (printer, computer etc) - it ensures that data flows smoothly between the devices preventing congestion and ensuring efficiate communication

**Router** play the role of a traffic cop directing traffic between different entworks essentially direct traffic between diffrent networks. The role of a router at home is connecting your home network to the internet, it ensures data gets to the right place 
when browsing the internet or watching videos. - The two roles it plays is directing traffic in the network and connecting to different networks.

**Firewals** is basically a security guard for your network as it monitors incoming and outgoing network traffic based on the rules set in place. It does two things, protects the network from unauthorised access and monitoring incoming/outgoing network traffic. 

These **there** components form the backbone of any network.

**IP Addr** oe internet protocol address is a unique identifier assigned to each device on a network. Allows devices to Locate and Communicate with each other. There are two types of IP addresses such as IPv4 and IPv6, the most common one is IPv4 and start with 192.168...

IPv4- They are 32 bit addresses, written in Four decimal numbers separated by dots and each group and go up to 255 providing up to 4.3 billion unique addresses. With how rapid the internet is growing, IPv4 address are becoming scarce (starting to run out) which is 
where IPv6 Addresses come in.

IPv6- are 128 bit addresses. that provider a much wider pool of addresses. These are written in 8 groups of four hexadecimal digits separated by colons. Without IP addresses, devices wouldn't know where to send or receive data.

**MAC Addr** or otherise known as the Media Access Control Address is a unique identifier assigned to a network interface, meaning each device has it's own unique MAC address. MAC addr are 48 bit addresses that look something like the below picture. This network protocl 
operates in the data link layer and facilitates device identification within a local network. It also crucial for ensuring your laptop connects to the correct router and not a neighbours one.
